                        Intrepid offers a wide range of Family Adventures around the globe. The minimum age (for Family
                        trips) varies depending on destination, and Intrepid has set minimum ages to ensure that the
                        included activities suit each age range. Additionally, you’ll notice that some of the more
                        adventurous destinations have a higher minimum age. Please view our family adventures for more
                        information.

                        Food is one of the most exciting parts of travel. There may be some familiar fare but often
                        you’ll be confronted with the new, interesting and downright weird of the culinary world but we
                        like to think of it as an adventure for all the senses. In addition to this, our flexible
                        itineraries often allow you to eat with the group or branch out on your own - this means you can
                        eat to suit any budget or desire.
